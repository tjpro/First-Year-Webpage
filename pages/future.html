    <!--Here, I talk about becoming a professional engineer.-->

    <p>
        So, you just finished your four year degree in engineering? Great! But it doesn't stop there. You can push yourself to be a little bit better. You can become a licensed <i>professional engineer</i>. After graduating, you are required to work under an already registered engineer, complete two exams, and be certified by the state's licensure board. Once you do so, you will be a fully licenced professional engineer. Becoming a professional engineer shows that you have what it takes to make big decisions and make the right choices when you have to.</br></br>
        I would want to become a professional engineer because I want to prove to myself that I am capable of being one of the best. Additionally, becoming a professional engineer gives you a title that is very attractive to employers, well-respected by others in the field, and trusted by clients. Having this type of certification would give me chances and oppertunites that I never thought possible.</br></br>
        As a professional engineer, I will be able to work on large projects and because I am certified, I will have to give my seal of approval before anything can go forward with it. This means that I can review the project, designs, and impact it can have before it can do any harm. As a professional engineer, I will have the knowledge and competence to make an informed decision that will follow the code of ethics as closely as possible. Professional engineers help to keep the public out of harms way by approving or disapproving designs, as well as helping make proper ones that will benefit the populus as a whole.
