            Engineers are everywhere and quite honestly, they can do just about anything. Engineers use science and mathematics to develop solutions to challenges presented to them. These challenges can pertain to just about anything. Engineers can develop new inventions, build buildings and bridges, redesign computers, create prosthetics and so much more.
            <br /><br />
            Engineers are brought in to solve complex problems in the most simplistic and effective ways possible. These complex problems are something that they enjoy and it is a challenge that they are up to. There are many different types of engineering and even more concentrations. Some of these fields include:

        <!--This is an ordered list about the different possible jobs for engineers-->

        <ol type="A" start="4">

            <li>
                Bioengineering
            </li>

            <li>
                Chemical and Petroleum Engineering
            </li>

            <li>
                Civil and Environmental Engineering
            </li>

            <li>
                Electrical and Computer Engineering
            </li>

            <li>
                Industrial Engineering
            </li>

            <li>
                Mechanical and Materials Engineering
            </li>

        </ol>

        <p>
            All of these paths offer their own special concentrations that they deal with everyday. Some civil engineerers work with bridges. Mechanical Engineers can work on cars. Moreover, petroleum engineers can work on natural gas sights. All of these career fields are out there. However, there is on in particular that interests me.

            Ever since I was a kid, I have been facinated with computers. My father was an IT worker at the local hospital and when monitor and computers would break, he would bring them home and fix them. I was always very interested in what he was doing and I loved the idea of working on computers.

            Computer engineering is a mix of two very interesting programs. It is a degree that mixes the electrical hardware work that electrical engineers do and combines it with the software work that computer science majors do. This field turns both of these careers into one. You are specifically trained to work on computer hardware and software. Here are some jobs that computer engineers could have:

            <ol type="i">
                <li>
                    Software Engineer
                </li>

                <li>
                    Hardware Engineer
                </li>

                <li>
                    Robotics Engineer
                </li>

                <li>
                    Software Developer
                </li>

                <li>
                    Embedded Systems Consultant
                </li>

                <li>
                    Web Applications Developer
                </li>

                <li>
                    Cyber Security Administrator
                </li>

            </ol>

            <br />
            One thing to remember is that a computer engineer is not limited to working on the everyday PC that people use. I only listed a few jobs that were interesting to me. A computer engineer can also work on projects that range from writing software to optimize railroad logistics to making the newest touch screen for this year's Ferrari. The possibilities with this degree are endless.
