            Hello! Welcome to my webpage! My name is Tyler Protivnak and I'd like to tell you a little bit about myself before we begin. I was born April 23, 1996 in Philadephia, PA. I am the son of my two very loving parents, Larry and Marlene Protivnak. I'm not alone in this family either. I have an older brother, Alex, and a younger brother, Jack. Alex is 20 years old and also attends the University of Pittsburgh. Jack is 16 years old and attends Saint Joseph High School in Natrona Heights, PA.

            When I was two years old, my family moved from the Philadelphia area and made our way out to the wild and wonderful land known as Butler, PA. We originally lived in a small suburb called Highfield. We lived in Highfield for a few short years before we moved into our current home. Our home is in Meridian, not far from Highfield.

            As a child, I went to Butler Catholic School. I was there for kindergarden through 8th grade. At BCS, I made some of my best friends including Chris Gamble, Kate Kletzli, and Emma Preston. Fortunately for me, they all came to the same high school as me, Saint Joseph High School. Here, I made many more friends including Sam Thimons, Jack Herbst, and Rachel Schratz. This group of friends became my close family over the years and they, along with my family, are the people I lean on. I'm very blessed and lucky to have these people in my life. With their help, I went on to become a co-valedictorian at my high school and move on to study engineering here at the university.
