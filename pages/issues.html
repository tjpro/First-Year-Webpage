        Virtual Reality: Real World Military Application
    </h1>

    <h2 align="center">
        WARFARE EVOLVED
    </h2>

        <p>
            There is no denying that world militaries have always been influenced by new technologies. The use of stone weapons was quickly replaced by those made of forged iron or copper. These melee weapons were dispatched by the long range capabilities of gunpowder. Then rifling brought us the modern rifle that we see today. However, there is one important thing to note. All of this technology was beneficial because it was in the hands of trained users.
            <br /><br />
            Traditionally, soldiers were trained in large groups in military compounds. They would march, run through drills, and also reenact combat situations. These are tried and true methods that have been around for thousands of years. However, keeping technology in mind, what if you could train a better soldier? What if you could harness the power of the hi-tech age that we are in and give soldiers the best, most realistic, most immersive training possible? I want you to picture this.
            <br /><br />
            You are in Kabul, Afghanistan. You are part of an explosive ordinance disposal unit charged with the task of disarming a suspected IED found by a local taxi driver. As the point man, you are suited up in over 75 pounds of protective gear that you are praying will protect you if you accidentally detonate the explosive [1]. As you approach the bomb site, you feel your heart racing. This is what you have been training for. You find the IED in a backpack leaning against the wheel of a parked car. You open the pack to see a timer ticking down… with only ten seconds left on it. There are two wires, red and blue. One disarms the bomb, the other detonates it. You think… “Which one do I cut?” Five seconds left. “I have to pick one.” Three seconds left. “I hope I’m right.” You cut the red wire. There is a bright light then everything goes black. The text “MISSION FAILED” pops up in your virtual reality goggles. You didn’t die. You were training. Your commanding officer pats you on the shoulder as you take off the headset.
            <br /><br />
            “You’ll get it next time, son. It’s all about practice.”
            <br /><br />
            The use of virtual reality in the military setting is becoming increasingly popular and provides a safe, cheap, and effective alternative to some traditional training methods.

        WHAT IS VIRTUAL REALITY?
    </h2>
    <h3 align="center">
        Virtual Reality Explained
    </h3>

        <p>
            Virtual reality (VR) is an up and coming technology that many different people have many different definitions for. But even with all these differences, there are a few concrete aspects of virtual reality that everyone agrees upon. The best technical definition of VR is a computer generated, interactive, three-dimensional environment which a person is immersed. Gr Capt Ajey Lele, research fellow with the Institute for Defense Studies and Analysis, put it more simply in his article “Virtual reality and its military utility” by saying, “…VR is an artificial environment created using information technology tools… and presented to the user in such a way that it appears and feels like any real environment” [2]. For virtual reality to work, it has to feel real. The user must feel completely immersed in the environment in order for them to believe they are in this alternate reality. To fully immerse the user, the virtual environment must take advantage of the user’s senses.
            <br /><br />
            Most commonly, the use of a head mounted display (HMD) and headphones are used to interact with the user. The HMD will track the positions of the eyes and detect the movement of the user’s head. If the user turns his or her head to the left in the real world, their display will do the same thing in the virtual world by turning the camera by the same amount. By turning same amount, the illusion feels real. The user feels immersed and the user believes the virtual world to be real.
            <br /><br />
            Other input devices like special gloves or full body suits, both of which are covered with sensors, allow for further realism by allowing other body movements to be tracked and then displayed in the virtual environment [3]. This style of virtual training is part of one of currently used systems known as Dismounted Soldier. This is the current virtual training system used by the Army. Dismounted Soldier is powered by the cutting-edge game engine, CryENGINE 3. With this game engine, simulations that are more realistic than ever before, can be created. It gives commanders the ability to change combat situation to anything they desire. Simulations can be during the day or night, in a blizzard or sand storm. Other elements such as enemy patrols, snipers, and civilians can be added to the environment to create the most realistic training simulations possible. These images are displayed in HMDs that each soldier wears along with full combat gear. Along with the usual sensor gloves and helmets, users are also equipped with rifles covered in movement sensors. They can track the accuracy of all the shots each soldier takes. Possibly the biggest development that this system has over traditional ones is the use of an electronic mat. This ten foot by ten foot mat is used to track every step the soldier takes. It uses the collected data and translates it into movement within the system. The mat can pick up signals when the soldier stands up, crouches down, and jumps. When the user performs any of those actions, the picture inside the HMD shows, in the environment, exactly what would happen in real life. Instead of having a backpack full of bullets and supplies, they are filled with super computers that compile all of the sensory information together. This virtual experience is made even better because of the compact nature of the system. Only 1600 square feet of space is required. Whether inside, outside, in Texas or in Iraq, the system can be used anywhere the mats and computers can be set up.
            <br /><br />
            Another system in development is called the Immersive Training System. This system places soldiers inside a 12 foot diameter sphere. When the screens are turned on, the system displays a 360 degree programmed environment. The system uses sensors similar to those in the Dismounted Soldier system with the addition of one component. Cubic Defense Systems, creators of the Immersive Training System, invented what they call a “pain belt.” This pain belt uses data it receives from the computer system and tells the soldiers when they get shot by striking them with simulated pain. The belt can give a realistic pain that once again adds to the realism of the system. Another added component of realism that can be added to the dome environment takes advantage of the senses of smell and touch. Gases that simulate the smell of burnt gunpowder from spend shells, sewage from crowded streets, or smoke from a fire can be injected into the dome. At the same time, heat and wind effects can be added to provide an even more immersive experience [5]. When all of the different inputs and programs work seamlessly together, they create an environment that the brain believes. Programmers can design infinitely many missions with adaptive environments that put soldiers to the test. A simulated combat situation can put your body through nearly the same stress as the real thing. The screens inside the goggles, combined with the headphones, combined with the realism of the computer generated environment creates a genuinely believable training experience for soldiers. These simulations allow soldiers to run convoy missions on IED infested roads, get ambushed in while on a steep mountain pass, or run patrols in areas mixed with civilians and enemies. The possibilities are endless and the dramatic and physical sensations felt while undergoing the missions only make the soldiers more experienced.

        Military Usage
    </h3>

        <p>
            Even though the military already has started to take advantage of this new technology, they know that VR isn’t perfect. Their main reason to take advantage of it is for financial reasons. Daniel Taylor, correspondent for the magazine SEAPOWER, wrote after interviewing multiple military personnel, “Simulation cannot replace all training” [6]. There are certain things that a soldier must experience. One of these experiences is known as a live fire exercise. These are training missions where real bullets are used and real people can get hurt if they make a mistake. They are also known to be “…very expensive… and logistically intensive, requiring the movement of soldiers and all of their equipment” [7]. To perform a proper live fire exercise, soldiers need to come in with a specific skill set. This skill set includes some of the basic know-how the soldiers must have including weapons training, marching formations, hand signals, and fire support roles. These are all skills that can be learned using VR and then implemented at live fire exercises. Taylor also went on to say how VR has the added benefit that “you can do it on a trainer a million times” [6]. VR allows you to try all sorts of different missions multiple times until you get it right. In the past, troops would spend extensive amounts of time learning these different skills in the classroom and on the training grounds on base. Now, with VR, they can cut down on all of the costs of those training exercises by practicing them in a computer generated environment. Then with the skills that they have mastered, soldiers can get the most out of the live fire exercises. Going through these virtual exercises before the live training enhances the reaction times, decision making, and awareness of troops, supplementing their overall training experience.

        BRIDGING THE GAP BETWEEN WORLDS

    <h3 align="center">
        The Problems
    </h3>

        <p>
            The realism and immersion of this system is of the utmost importance. If the user does not feel totally immersed in the virtual world, the illusion that the dangers are real is lost. If that happens, VR has failed. Some of the enhancements that would have to be made involve the interaction of touch with the system. Imagine there is a ball in the generated environment. The user, using the special gloves, can interact with the ball in the virtual world. But in real life, they don’t actually feel a tactile sensation. There is no physical ball that the users can feel. The user needs to act like it is there. This simple job is exceptionally challenging in VR. As stated by Ajey Lele, “In the virtual environment, where no haptic feedback is provided, the control of the ball must exclusively be accomplished through the visual system” [2]. This basically reiterates that there is no sensory feedback for that ball. The only feedback that the user receives is seeing the ball in their hands in the HMD. This problem does take away from the realism of the system and would be noticeable to soldiers using the equipment. Another problem with VR is that it still is lacking visually. Current processors and graphics processing units are not able to handle the extreme computing power to make a near perfect world. From an engineer’s point of view, the realism of the system is what we can improve. Adding realism immerses the troops even more and allows them to benefit from training even more. If we, as engineers, can improve virtual reality as a whole and make it cheaper, better, and more accessible to our troops, the impact will be immense.

        The Benefits
    </h3>

        <p>
            Even with these flaws, VR is a promising innovation. The United States armed forces already sees the benefits. After doing extensive research alongside military analysts, Sandra Erwin, editor of National Defense, found that, “The Air force estimates it could save about $1.7 billion over five years by reducing flying hours by 5 percent… the Navy believes that a roughly $500 million investment in flight simulators over seven years could lower aviation training costs by $119 million” [8]. Additionally, she found that “the live training cost of one F-1 5E flight hour, for instance, is about $17,449, and the plan would be to cut 1,782 hours… and save $31 million” [8]. All of these estimates are based on the assumption that the military makes only minimal cuts to live training and instead uses simulations. The increase in efficiency and decrease in cost makes this an attractive option to the military considering the recent defense budget cuts. The added benefit is that VR cuts down the dangers that go into training using live bullets or flying planes. Safety is a number one concern when it comes to our troops.

        BETTERING LIVES
    </h2>

        <p>
            On a personal level, I come from a family with many veterans. I also have been fascinated with computers my entire life. This topic mixed both of these interests together. I know our military is filled with brave men and women that can and should be equipped with the very best tools and have the sharpest skills in the world. As a future engineer, it will be exciting to work with such advanced technology. Part of being an engineer is creating things and fixing problems in order to make peoples’ lives better. What could be a better way to make someone’s life easier than ensuring them (the soldiers) and their families a sense of safety and security? As a computer engineer, I will be able to work on projects like graphics card production that would improve the environment. I could also have the opportunity to work on the sensor gloves or suits that would perform better than the ones that are used today. As engineers, we can work with virtual reality and other technologies to ensure the safety and effectiveness of our troops.
