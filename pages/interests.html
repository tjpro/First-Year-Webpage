                    <dd>I can do what I want, when I want. I am on my own to make mistakes, succeed, and fail all depending on what I do  and do not do. It can be intimidating at first but if you can treat this freedom with a healthy dose of respect, it will prepare you for adult life.</dd>

                    <dd>Learning in college is different than anything you have probably experienced before.

                    <dd>Living in Forbes hall, I have met some of my best friends because we found common ground in what we were studying. As engineers, we work, learn, and succeed in groups.

                    <dd>The University of Pittsburgh is a beautiful place to study and live. Pittsburgh offers such a fun, friendly, and diverse environment to experience. Downtown has an awesome culture district. The strip district is a fun place to explore. Finally, south side is great place to find food. Overall, there is a lot to do and more than enough to explore.</dd>
